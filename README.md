If you don't have python on you machine you need to download from here [website](https://www.python.org/).
To check if you python or not on your machine do the following 
 1-run you CMD 
 2-write python 
if your machine recognized the comand and told you the version then you have pyhton if not you don't have.


# How to run the app 

1- In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 
2- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
